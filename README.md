# Work-Performance-Prediction-using-ML

# Overview
This project utilizes machine learning, specifically a Random Forest Classifier, to predict work performance based on user inputs. By analyzing factors such as age, sleep duration, stress level, sleep disorder, gender, and BMI category, the model categorizes work performance into distinct levels. The goal is to provide insights that can help in understanding and potentially improving individual productivity.

# Features
🎯 Predicts work performance levels using various personal and lifestyle features.  
🧠 Employs a Random Forest Classifier for robust and accurate predictions.  
📊 Achieves high accuracy through meticulous data preprocessing and feature engineering.  
💻 Offers an interactive web interface for seamless user experience.
